- 预计学时：

Prof. Robert Berwick 讲课中说道: "In fact, I would almost urge most of you not to take a course in measure theory now. Because once you get all the way into measure theory, you are so far into measure theory that you cannot come back and think about real problems anymore. You are suddenly stuck in the world of mathematics. " 因此还不熟悉测度论的同学也不必特别担心.
